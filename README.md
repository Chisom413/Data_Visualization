# Data_Visualization

## Description: 
Conducted a comprehensive analysis of a pharmaceutical study using Python libraries, including Matplotlib, Pandas, and SciPy, to explore the effectiveness of various drug regimens for treating squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) in mice.

## Key Highlights:

### Data Preparation:
Cleaned and merged datasets, identified and removed duplicate data points, and ensured accuracy for 249 unique mice tracked over 45 days.

### Statistical Analysis:
Generated summary statistics for tumor volume (mean, median, variance, standard deviation, and SEM) across drug regimens to compare treatment efficacy.

### Visualizations:
Created bar charts and pie charts to illustrate drug regimen distribution and gender breakdown of test subjects.

Developed box plots to visualize tumor volume distributions and identify potential outliers in key drug regimens.

Produced a line plot tracking tumor volume over time for a specific mouse treated with Capomulin.

Designed a scatter plot correlating mouse weight with average tumor volume under the Capomulin regimen.

### Correlation and Regression:
Calculated the correlation coefficient and implemented a linear regression model to demonstrate the relationship between mouse weight and tumor volume under Capomulin.
